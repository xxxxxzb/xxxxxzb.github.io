I'm a first-grade post-graduate from [School of Computer](http://www.cs.ecnu.edu.cn/), [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics and machine learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Xinli Huang(https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s16/hxl/main.psp) from [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ecnu.edu.cn/), East China Normal University.
